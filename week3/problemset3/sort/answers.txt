sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: This was the fastest for the sorted txts, but it was the slowest for the randoms

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: sort 2 was the fastest when doing random txts, and reversed for me, so I assumed it had to be merge sort

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: sort 3 was the slowest when doing the sorted 5000/10k/50k, so it was iterating through each instance.
