HARVARD CS50 

This repository contains assignments from the class I took in the spring semester of 2025.

Although I had a background in programming, I wanted to refresh on my foundational skills while I was in between jobs.
This was a fun challenge since I have coded in Python, C++, and R, but had not programmed in C. Additionally I got to use JS and HTML for the first time since middle school.
Overall great class and really great professors, highly reccommend.
